# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one: 
  name: "Shield 1"
  armor: 10
# column: value
#
two:
  name: "Shield 2"
  armor: 100
